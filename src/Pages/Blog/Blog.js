        <p>
           In programming, we often want to take something and extend it.
For instance, we have a user object with its properties and methods, and want to make admin and guest as slightly modified variants of it. Weâ€™d like to reuse what we have in user, not copy/reimplement its methods, just build a new object on top of it.
Prototypal inheritance is a language feature that helps in that.

        <p>
        unit tasting is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected.
